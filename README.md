# InstaCleanser

InstaCleanser is a desktop application that allows users to navigate their Instagram following and followers. The key feature of this tool is the ability to identify and unfollow users who do not follow back, helping to maintain a balanced and organized follower list.  

## Notice - InstaCleanser is not currently being pushed to git, I have had issues with my laptop and am currently working to recover and push files correctly now.

## Features  
- View a list of users you follow and compare it against your followers  
- Identify accounts that do not follow you back  
- Unfollow non-followers directly from the application  
- Simple and clean user interface using CustomTkinter  
- Secure authentication and data retrieval using Instaloader
